= What fields in Salesforce can I populate? =
Currently, you can populate:
* Email Address
* First & Last Name (split from a full name field)
* Phone Number
* Lead Source
* ID Status

= What about address? Other fields? =
Not yet, sorry.

= Is this compatible with my version of WordPress? =
My time for testing this has thus far been limited, so I have not tested on older versions of WordPress. I would recommend you try this and see if it works for you.
